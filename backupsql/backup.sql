This is my 1st blogpost on this blog, this blog is shared between me and my girlfriend.\n\nI built it because\n\n* I love building stuffs\n* I'd like to have some projects/hobby that my girlfriend could be involve, and having a blog shared by us sounds like a good idea, she could come up with design idea, and I'll implement them, we get to discuss, and this will be a great experience\n* I hope this blog could become a portal of all my projects and visitor can run those project directly through this portal, thus it's better for me to have full control over the system.\n\n\nThe source of this blog is available [here](https://github.com/buaya91/just-us-blog)	2016-05-29	{self}

As the saying goes, "A real woman can do it all by herself, but a real Man won't let her." \n\nHonestly, I am really a demanding girlfriend to my love. However, if being a girlfriend cannot even request, why do we still need a man. Please take note I am asking for a MAN, not just a BOY to be my boyfriend.\n\n![pic](https://scontent-ams3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/12501625_536492306554191_559254713_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTIxNTI4NTE5ODI3ODAyNjM0OQ%3D%3D.2.l)\n \nThank you to my love for making this blog comes true.

The token can then serve as a session. |\n| [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/) | A convenient library to provide many commonly used UI widget in a composable way, this complement React pretty well, as React provide easy way to compose UI, but building them from scratch can still be a pain |\n| Color scheme | As a backend guy, I actively avoid making UI decision from time to time, but not this time, since I fully own the project, I learn a little bit about complementary colors, analogous color and how to pick 3 colors that play well from the color wheel |\n\n<br/>\n\n| ES6/7 (Javascript) |\n| ------ |\n| Generators | This is not a new concept, but I never had a close look on it until very recent, generator is useful to model side effect, it is the fundamental construct that power redux-saga. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| Scala |\n| ----- |\n| Scalatest | Should disable db connection pooling when running test, as test framework does not release connection until test finish |\n	2016-05-25	{programming}

7	l.q.wei91@gmail.com	Tutorial on akka http websocket push 	Recently I need to achieve websocket push in akka http and found out it was not very well documented, there are some pieces scattered in the internet here and there. \n\nSo I decided to write this short tutorial to show how to achieve that.\n\nBefore start reading, here's a quick demo.\n<iframe src="/ws-push" allow-forms height="350" width="500"></iframe>\n\nClick <span style="color: orange">connect</span> will establish a websocket connection, which server will push some random number to client.\n\n|  Dependency   |  Version    |\n| ------------- | ----- | \n| Akka | 2.4.7 |\n| Scala | 2.11.8 |\n\nThis tutorial assume you have basic knowledge on [akka-http](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/http/routing-dsl/index.html)\n\nWe want to host an url that accepts websocket connection, and once connection established, it will constantly push some data to client, client request from websocket connection will be ignore for the sake of this tutorial.\n\n### Websocket route\nLet's start by defining a route using akka-http DSL\n> ```\n>   val route = path("ws-push") {\n>     handleWebSocketMessages(serverPushHandler)\n>   }\n> ```\n\nNotice the signature of `handleWebSocketMessages`\n> ```\n> def handleWebSocketMessages(handler: Flow[Message, Message, Any]): Route\n> ```\n\nIt accepts a Flow[Message, Message, Any], the good old request response mechanism that we are familiar with, but it's not very obvious if we could use it to implement a websocket endpoint that do server push.\n\nIt turns out we could, and it pretty easy, so our task is to define a `Flow[Message, Message, Any]` that send out data independent to client request, and ignore all client request.\n\n### Flow implementation\n\n```\ndef serverPushHandler: Flow[Message, Message, NotUsed] = \n  Flow.fromGraph(GraphDSL.create() { \n    implicit b =>\n      import GraphDSL.Implicits._\n\n      val ignoreInput = b.add(Sink.ignore)\n      val actor = Source.actorPublisher[String](Props[WSPushActor])\n\n      val randomOutputSource = b.add(actor)\n      val stringToMsg = b.add(Flow[String].map(s => TextMessage(s)))\n\n      randomOutputSource ~> stringToMsg\n\n      FlowShape(ignoreInput.in, stringToMsg.out)\n  })\n```\n\nLet's go through them step by step\n\n#### ```Flow.fromGraph(GraphDSL.create() ... ```\nGraph is an important concept in akka-stream, you can think a Graph as a collection of interconnected processing stages, it defines the topology of processing stages. `Flow.fromGraph` is a helper method that create Flow from Graph.\n\n```GraphDSL.create``` is a curried function that allow us to define custom processing stage and connect them the way we want\n\nHere's a simplified signature\n\n>> ```\n>>  def create()(buildBlock: (Builder[NotUsed]) ⇒ S): Graph[S, NotUsed]\n>> ```\n\nWe need to define correct implementation of `buildBLock`, which has a signature of \n```Builder[NotUsed] ⇒ S```\n\n\n1. ```\n implicit builder =>\n import GraphDSL.Implicits._ \n```\nBoilerplate\n\n2.  ```\n val ignoreInput = builder.add(Sink.ignore)\n```\nDefine a processing stage that ignore incoming data, Sink is a processing stage that have 1 input port\n\n3.  ```\n val actor = Source.actorPublisher[String](Props[WSPushActor])\n```\nHere, we create a Source from an actorPublisher, so when we materialize/run this Source, it will spawn an actor, which that actor can emit data into the Source, note that from this statement we can tell that the Source will emit String.\nWe will go into details of the actor later\n\n4.  ```\n val randomOutputSource = builder.add(actor)\n```\n`builder.add` will create an immutable processing stage to be used in this Graph\n\n5.  ```\n val stringToMsg = b.add(Flow[String].map(s => TextMessage(s)))\n```\nThis is a processing stage that takes input and convert it into TextMessage\n\n6. ```\nrandomOutputSource ~> stringToMsg\n```\nHere we make use of the pretty `~>` which means connect this 2 processing stage, so data emitted by Source will be pump into `stringToMsg` pipe\n\n7. ```\nFlowShape(ignoreInput.in, stringToMsg.out)\n```\nFinally, we return a shape that looks like Flow, so that it can later be converted into Flow, a Flow has one input port and one output port, which is obtained by `ignoreInput.in` and `stringToMsg.out` respectively.\n\nSo finally we would have a Flow[Message, Message, _] that will ignore incoming Message, and have an actor that control pushing data down to websocket client.\n\nThe last piece of the puzzle is the Actor, which we created with `Source.actorPublisher`, below is the implementation.\n\n\n### Actor publisher\n> ```\n>  // ActorPublisher[String] that publish string\n> class WSPushActor extends ActorPublisher[String] {\n      \n>   // 1. a scheduler that send "Lucky number"\n>   //     to this actor every 1 second\n>   val tick = context.system\n>      .scheduler.schedule(1 second, 1 second, self, "Lucky number")\n\n>   // 2. a scheduler that send\n>   //  "Cancel" to this actor after 1 minute\n>   val cancelAfter1Min = context.system\n>       .scheduler.scheduleOnce(1 minutes, self, "Cancel")\n>   override def receive: Receive = {\n>     case "Cancel" => {   // 3. if receive "Cancel"\n>       onNext("Ended")    // cancel the tick scheduler\n>       tick.cancel()\n>     }\n>     case msg: String => {\n>       if (isActive && totalDemand > 0) {\n>         val random = Random.nextInt()\n>         val s = s"${msg} $random"\n>         onNext(s)               // publish a random Int to Source\n>       }\n>     }\n>   }\n> }\n> ```\n\nTwo points\n* calling onNext will publish data to subscriber, in our case the Source\n* calling onNext might result in runtime exception if actor is not active or downstream have no demand, which can be check by `isActive` and `totalDemand`, this is to maintain backpressure\n\nSo, by using an actor publisher, you can hook the websocket stream to any of your existing actor system.\n\n### Conclusion\nAkka-stream is an awesome library, but it certainly is confusing to beginner like me, I think we need more accessible documentation to describe relationship between each commonly used abstraction. I am starting to understand some of it, and it starts to shine due to composability and well integration with actor system.\n\n### References:\n* http://www.smartjava.org/content/create-reactive-websocket-server-akka-streams\n* http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.7/scala/stream/stream-composition.html\n* http://doc.akka.io/api/akka/current/#akka.stream.actor.ActorPublisher	2016-06-12	{programming}
3	l.q.wei91@gmail.com	Redux best practices	I've been using ReactJS professionally for quite sometime, so I intend to record some of my findings and hope someone finds it useful\n\n\n## 1. setState for local UI state\nCompared to storing everything in redux's `store`, letting Component to handle their own has the benefit of \n* more direct, `setState -> render -> shouldComponentUpdate` instead of `action -> store -> render -> shouldComponentUpdate` \n* more readable as you can know what happen to the state just by looking at the Component's code, without digging into the action and reducer.\n\nan example of local UI state would be whether a `checkbox` is checked or not, `{checked: true}`\n\n## 2. Reducer should be pure\nThis is being repeated in quite a lot of places, one reason being impure reducer will break the time travel functionality of redux-dev-tools, as you cannot revert side effect.\n[More details](https://github.com/rackt/redux/blob/master/docs/basics/Reducers.md)\n\n## 3. Use Redux-Saga for side-effects\nActions should be the only way Component interact with outside world (store, ajax or websocket call). This will simplify the component, and provide a simpler, less buggy architecture. \n\nOne way perform side effects via actions is to use *Action Creator* with [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk), but soon you will find thunk being unwieldy as actions are now very complex, and difficult to test, and complex stuff should be tested.\n\nA better alternative would be [redux-saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga), it is subjectively cleaner and objectively more testable.\n\nUpdate: I am adopting ***redux-saga***, it makes code more readable, an important aspect is it feels more idiomatic, as now you do not mix dump action creator with those scary `Async action creator that fire 3 api call`, when you see Saga, you can be sure it's about side effects handling, or some dynamic state changes that depends on store.\n\n## 4. Smart Component vs Dumb Component\nSeparate components into two categories, \n* Smart - Components that have direct access to store and actions\n* Dumb - Components that have no direct access to store and actions\nThis allow Dumb components to be highly composable and seldom need to be change.\n\nOne rule of thumb is \n> Smart component for concrete implementation, eg. `Header of sites`\n\n> Dumb component for more generic usage, eg. `container type component`\n\nThere are a few more rules to be consider, kindly check link below.\n[More details](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0#.20fvey2us)\n\n## 5. Data reshape\nIn many cases, the external data model will not match your app's internal model requirement, \nexample external api return an array `['Female', '178cm', '55kg']` , but you want `{gender: 'F', height: '178', weight: '55'}`\n\nso where should we perform this restructure?\n\nWe have 4 options:\n* In selectors\n* In component\n* In reducer\n* In actionCreators or Saga\n\nGenerally we should reshape data either in `reducer` or `saga / actionCreator`, because we want to have easy to use data model as soon as possible. And since the data source (reducer) are being shared, operations on the data will likely be reusable for different consumer.\n\n## 6. Selectors should follow SRP\nSelectors should only have 1 reason to be triggered, if selectors have more than 1 reason to be triggered, some of the computation would be meaningless, it will not affect program correctness if things are pure, but it would means unnecesary computations.\n	2016-07-30	{programming,reactjs}

As you live longer, the more bills you have to pay so start to learn financial planning now. \n\n### Think > Do \n\nThis is the part you will find out where you are. \nAn action oriented person who takes future in your hands or the Sun Tzu strategist who knows the art of war but did not feel the challenging excitement. \n\n### Although I keep my positivity on all those mentioned, I miss the age when I thought I would have all my shit together by the time I was the age I am now.	2016-07-28	{self}
8	l.q.wei91@gmail.com	Why learning math is hard?	Recently, I am trying to pick up some basic math, which is needed in my side project.\n\nI was pretty good in mathematics in high school, so I was expecting I am able to pick things up relatively quick and then jump back to my coding project to proceed.\n\nAnd things turn out quite the opposite (Like always), in the learning process, I formed an opinion that Math is difficult because the way we learn math is the opposite of the way we learn other subjects. \n\nFor example when learning biology, we first started from the environment.\n\n### This is a tiger\n![tiger](https://just-us.xyz/tiger1.jpg)\n\n### This is also a tiger\n![tiger](https://just-us.xyz/tiger2.jpg)\n\n### This is a ... \n![](http://img.chan4chan.com/img/2012-02-28/how-many.jpg)\n\nWe learn by looking at different objects that represent the same concept repeatedly, and then our brain will attempt to generalize over them to form knowledge over a specific concept. After all, a big part of our brain is a pattern matching engine.\n\nBut when it comes to Mathematics, things are pretty different, here I am referring to College Level Math.\n\nThe syllabus generally starts with definition of certain concepts, for example `What is Vector`, and build a reasoning system from there. After you have digested those material, you will start to spot Math in many places in real world [Math is everywhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGQ8MPMYZ2I)\n\nThe problem is many if not most people never actually digest those highly abstract material, because the learning process is not what we've used to. \n\n> Most of the time, we learn from concrete examples, and form abstract concepts, so that we could apply them in real world scenario\n\n> In learning Math, we first learn some abstract concepts, then only we try to map them back to the real world.\n\nWhich I believe is one of the factor Math got it's reputation, I propose we could improve it, instead of teaching from basic concepts, we should \n\n1. show students a real world problem\n2. reduce it into a mathematical problem\n3. propose a new math concept that solve the problem.\n\nI speculate such method would provide 2 merits.\n\n1. boost student motivation of learning, as the relationship between the material and the real world is clear.\n2. it provides a real world reference for mathematical concepts, which means students can always refer to real world concrete examples when thinking of abstract concepts, less chance to lost in the abstract world.\n\n\n## Thanks for reading\n## Happy Learning ~!!\n\nPS: I am not an educator nor a Math expert, if I made any mistake in this article, please correct me =)	2016-08-14	{learning}

Scala.js is the new shiny kid in scala community, thus I decided to give it a try in my side project.\n\nIn this post I'll describe how to setup a project with both backend and frontend using scala, so you can effectively share code.\n\n### 1. Create a sbt project \nCreate 3 directory (backend, frontend, shared) roughly as follow\nIt should be clear that \n\n* `backend` module contains backend logic that runs on JVM backend\n* `frontend` module contains code to be compiled by scala.js and run in browser\n* `shared` module contains code being shared by both backend and frontend (normally model)\n\n![project-struct](https://just-us.xyz/projectstruct.png)\n\n### 2. Define project build\n* Remove sbt.build (we'll use build.scala)\n* Create a file in `./project/`, with format of `{project-name}.scala`, for this tutorial, it's `ExampleBuild.scala`\n* In the `ExampleBuild.scala`, create an scala object that extends `sbt.Build`\n\n![empty-build](https://just-us.xyz/emptybuild.png)\n\n### 3. Define subprojects build info\nIn the `ExampleBuild`, we need to define build details for each sub-modules.\nHere's an overview, we will look into details later.\n\n![overview](https://just-us.xyz/overview.png)\n\nAs you can see, we defined 1 project setting for each module, in addition there is a `root` settings which aggregate `frontend` and `backend`\n\n![shared](https://just-us.xyz/shared.png)\n\nLet's have a closer look on the `shared` module's settings\n\n`(crossProject.crossType(CrossType.Pure) in file ("shared"))` define the module root at a directory named `shared`, and this module should be cross-compile for both JVM and Scala.js, all these keywords are imported by\n\n> `import org.scalajs.sbtplugin.ScalaJSPlugin.AutoImport._`\n\nthen we can define settings of module like what we normally did by calling `.settings` method, here we defined 3 library dependencies.\n\n![](https://just-us.xyz/backfront.png)\n\nNext let's have a look on the other 2 sub-module settings, in the frontend settings, we need to enable scalaJSPlugin, by calling \n\n> `.enablePlugins(ScalaJSPlugin)`\n\non the settings\n\nand both backend and frontend settings need to specify their dependency to shared module so that code in shared module are accessible, it is done by\n\n> `.dependsOn(shared.js)`  for frontend\n\n> `.dependsOn(shared.jvm)` for backend\n\nAnd here you go, you've successfully setup the project, and you can now start coding ~\n\nTo compile `backend` project\n\n```\n> project backend\n> compile\n```\n\nTo compile `frontend` project\n\n```\n> project frontend\n> fastOptJS   \n// fullOptJS for production, the compiled javascript will be located at frontend/target/scala-2.11/frontend-fastopt.js\n```\n\nThanks for reading =)	2016-08-16	{learning,programming}
13	l.q.wei91@gmail.com	Month #1 in UK	Given there's enough amount of how unpredictable is the weather in UK, I'll skip that\n\nLet's talk a little bit about everything else =P\n\n## Food\nI've so far tried a few typical Chinese take-away shop which are typically operated by Cantonese speaking Chinese, food from there are decent, albeit there always are mines hidden somewhere in the menu, but so far nothing disastrous. However, given fish & chips is so common a food, I was expecting some really nice chips and got disappointed again and again (ok, only twice), but potato generally does not taste better here, guess the weather didn't help =P. \n\nKFC sucks big here, give me back my ![Hot & Spicy Fried Chicken](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CWU0i1cYqO0/TbA21W9Qi7I/AAAAAAAADB4/3iSz_NNRRQo/s1600/700px-KFC_Snack_Plate_1.JPG)\n\n## Work\nWork still feel like work, it is pretty unfortunate that it did not turn into [unicorn](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/0e/3d/f6/0e3df60cabeec611be2872b82db57458.jpg), luckily it's still quite pleasant.\n\n## Dear dear\nWith 8 hours time difference, we have less time to chat, but she still share her life with me from time to time, and still produce her masterpieces every now and then. <3 \nShe can't complain to me whenever she want now, which possibly a good thing ;-)\nOther than these, nothing much change, still much love, yay!\n\nWorking abroad does not make a super big difference after all, or maybe I am just insensitive =P\n\nCheers	2016-11-20	{UKLife}

My answer always in ... ... anything, as long as I am with you. \n\nIt's sweet, he appreciates it but doesn't value much. \n\nWhen we are running in long distance while texting, he initiated the habit of list down top 3 goals for the day after the usual morning greetings. My answer always in exercise, business calling and arrangements of casual gatherings. \n\nIt's still consider plan but his sticks to his out-of-work 's project schedules.\n\nNow I don't intend to recommend any of our "thing", but the story does have a great meaning. <u>You don't finish any goal in one big bite, but many small ones. </u> Too bad, I do not even have a big one so my daily actions stuck in normal routine. It's boring. On the other hand, he takes a small step each day towards where he wants to go and eventually he is working as professional at the United Kingdom now. \n\nThis reminds me of how far he has go and where I am now. \n![pic](https://scontent-sin6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14980781_10211016664353422_1398757311978538415_n.jpg?oh=97b3e5095f61fd7566d01298e5673cce&oe=58C7315A)\nBe not afraid of growing slowly; be afraid only of standing still. - Chinese Proverb\n千里之行始于脚下。不进则退。\n\nThank you for inspired me. 	2016-11-14	{learning,sicklyxpillpopper,relationshipgoals}

Heard that your boyfriend is at UK now, isn't it hard? I was like, of course it isn't easy... I would rather by his side right now, hug and feel him, while immerse in thy love... but here I am forced to be reminded again and again on how wish I could stay with him. \n\nI cried for the whole day after he told me on the so called good news of job offer in March. I was shock, surprised yet lost in the direction of our love. He was not expected I cried for the entire day because he could not understand my concerns and worries in continuing this long distance relationship (ldr). I was pessimistic.\n\n" It really meant something to me on why I could not stop my tears even till now ... "\n" Hey dear, I've no idea on why you did not think of tag me along =) "\n"... .... Why should I? What can I do there? "\n\n" All right, let's be clear. This is a great opportunity to my career, our life and even our future family. You should come with me. I can still afford our simple life while you are looking for your next career. It doesn't necessary needs to be in UK but then I hope you can take this chance to put on what you really love to do ...
